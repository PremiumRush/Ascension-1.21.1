# Ascension 1.21.1 NeoForge
This is a beginners' attempt on creating a mod for NeoForge 1.21.1.

I used the old 1.7.10 mod "Ascension" as inspiration and made my own mod out of it.

Note: I know NOTHING about coding and java, this project may never work at all

## Roadmap - (Don't mind this, these are just some notes)
Blocks:
- Infusion Table for Flerovium Related Items (Template and Infused Crystal)

Entities:
- Ice Blaze Mob (Spawns in Ice Spikes biome)
- Shark (Neutral but powerful Mob that spawns in deep oceans)
- Hostile Golem?
- Titanium / Ferrotitanium Golems (Similar or Opposite functionality of Minecraft Golems)


## Ideas - (Unsure or Distant Additions to the Game)
Items:
- Artifacts (Drop from various bosses, used to open Portal to Underworld Dimension)

Blocks:
- Artifact Pedestal
 
Entities:
- Pharaoh Boss
- +More?

Structures:
- Sphinx
- +More?

### Forgotton Lands Dimension:
General:
- Vast and Dry Dimension
- Occasional Lava Lakes
- Mostly foggy dimension
- Perhaps "pathways" through the dimension as carvers?

Items:
- Enchanted Book for a "Soul Speed" like block in the new Dimension

Blocks:
- Generally completely new Block-Palette in this dimension
- Coal, Redstone, Lapis, Gold and Diamond remain, Iron does not exist (More Titanium)
- New Upgrade to Diamond Gear (Like Netherite) from this dimension (Less Powerful than Flerovium though)

Structures:
- Rare, large castle structure with a "final" Boss
- Travelers Camps
- Ruins of a former Civilization
