# Ascension 1.21.1 NeoForge
This is a beginners' attempt on creating a mod for NeoForge 1.21.1.

I used the old 1.7.10 mod "Ascension" as inspiration and made my own mod out of it.

Note: I know NOTHING about coding and java, this project may never be publicly usable

## Roadmap
Blocks:

Entities:
- Mummies & Valkyries/Barbarians?


## Ideas - (Unsure or Distant Additions to the Game)
Items:
- Artifacts (Drop from various bosses, used to open Portal to New Dimension)

Blocks:
 
Entities:

Structures:

- +More?

### Forgotton Lands Dimension:
General:
- Vast and Dry Dimension
- Few Mountains (Rather Plateaus)
- Occasional Lava Lakes & Brown Water
- Mostly foggy dimension
- Perhaps "pathways" through the dimension as carvers?

Items:

Blocks:
- Generally completely new Block-Palette in this dimension
- No Vanilla Ores, perhaps a few more custom?
